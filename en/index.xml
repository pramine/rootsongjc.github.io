      <description>Github: https://github.com/rootsongjc/cloud-native-sandbox
Cloud Native Sandbox can help you setup a standalone Kubernetes and istio environment with Docker on you own laptop.
The sandbox integrated with the following components:
 Kubernetes v1.10.3 Istio v1.0.4 Kubernetes dashboard v1.8.3  Differences with kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster As I have created the kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster to set up a Kubernetes cluster and istio service mesh with vagrantfile which consists of 1 master(also as node) and 3 nodes, but there is a big problem that it is so high weight and consume resources.</description>

      <description>This article uses Istio&amp;rsquo;s official bookinfo example to explain how Envoy performs routing forwarding after the traffic entering the Pod and forwarded to Envoy sidecar by iptables, detailing the inbound and outbound processing. For a detailed analysis of traffic interception, see Understanding Envoy Sidecar Proxy Injection and Traffic Interception in Istio Service Mesh .
The following is a request flow diagram for bookinfo officially provided by Istio, assuming that the DestinationRule is not configured in all services of the bookinfo application.</description>
